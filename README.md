A collection of open source and free tools related to space exploration.

## Operation systems
- [Kubos](https://www.kubos.com/kubos/) - An open-source, integrated platform designed to increase development speed, lower risk, and allow teams to focus on their payload. KubOS packages Linux, subsystem APIs, and core services into a single platform. But we donâ€™t stop there, we provide intuitive developer tools, an SDK, documentation, and Service Level Agreement Support.

- [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) - Real time operation system for embedded devices.

## CAD and modelling

- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org) - FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size. Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify your design by going back into your model history and changing its parameters.

## Mission control center
- [OpenMCT](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/) - Open MCT (Mission Control Technologies) is a next-generation mission control framework for visualization of data on desktop and mobile devices. It is developed at NASA's Ames Research Center in collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and is being used by NASA for data analysis of spacecraft missions, as well as planning and operation of experimental rover systems. As a generalizable and open source framework, Open MCT could be used as the basis for building applications for planning, operation, and analysis of any systems producing telemetry data.
